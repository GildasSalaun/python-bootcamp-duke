# Rubric for Python Bootcamp class

This document outlines the rubric used for this class.

## 4 weekly assignment deliveries

Each week has its own assignment based on GitHub repositories. These
repositories are shared with you at the beginning of the week and you have
a full week to complete them.

The grading is automatic (auto-grading in the repository itself), and a pull
request is opened automatically as well so that your teacher and the TA's can
provide you with feedback.

For each week, there are a group of video lessons you have to go through. These
lessons cover everything you need to know in order to complete the assignment.

This class is a "Credit/No-Credit" class, so there is no individual grading or
percentage applied to each assignment.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must complete all assignments to get a credit. Failure to deliver an
> assignment at the end of the class will cause you to fail.
